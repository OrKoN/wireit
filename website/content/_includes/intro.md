## Smarter builds

<div class="side-by-side">

<div>

Wireit connects your npm scripts into a **smart build graph**, so running any script
ensures all prerequisite scripts also run when needed.

Wireit **tracks source files**, so scripts only run if their inputs have changed
since last time.

Wireit runs your scripts in **parallel** whenever possible, so you can get your
build done faster.

## Easy to adopt

Wireit doesn't change anything about the way you run your scripts, and there are
no new commands to learn. You can convert your scripts incrementally.

## Monorepos, individual packages, and workspaces

Wireit has no opinions about how you organize your code. It works equally well
with individual repos and monorepos. It works great with npm, yarn, and pnpm
workspaces with no additional configuration.

## Faster CI

Wireit integrates with the free GitHub Actions caching service to give you
granular caching of your build artifacts.

## VSCode Integration

The Wireit VSCode extension makes it easy to incrementally convert your scripts
to Wireit, plus inline documentation, jump-to-definition, and more.

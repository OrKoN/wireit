## Minimal philosophy

Wireit doesn't replace npm, it just makes your existing npm scripts smarter.

Use it on one script, or all of them. There are no new commands to learn.

Wireit has no opinions about your project layout. You can use it on single
packages, or monorepos of any complexity.

```sh
npm run build
npm test
npm test --watch
```
